                    * Atoms P and R are a pair of bonded atoms located in the incoming monomer.  
                    * Atoms Q and S are a pair of bonded atoms located in residue n of the existing polymer.
                    * Atoms P and Q are equivalent in the final polymer, and either P or Q is a dummy atom.
                    * Atoms R and S are equivalent in the final polymer, and either R or S is a dummy atom.
                    * Bonds PR and QS are equivalent in the final polymer.
                    `extend()` is agnostic as to which atom in each pair is real, and which atom is a dummy
                    after extension, you can use renamer() to explicilty set dummy atoms

                    axis to align along (e.g. align along x with ortho=[1,0,0]),

                    visually confirming structure is correct, defaults to False

        :param beta: beta is used to group monomers into 
                    categories, so that each branch can be separated. Beta is
                    analogous to segments. The tempfactors attribute of all of
                    the atoms in the incoming monomer are set to the value of 
                    beta, defaults to 0
        :type beta: int, optional

        For example: 
            {'P':'CMA','Q':'CA','R':'CN','S':'C'}, with n=1 and 
            nn=2 and joins=[('C','CA')] would produce a polymer of 
            '...-CA1-C1-CA2-C2-...'

        Further notes:
            * n and nn enable branching by specifying from and to connections between monomers and beta is analogous to segments 
            * extend a polymer 'u' by a monomer 'u_', by fitting the backbone atoms (P2, Q2) from the new monomer to (P1,Q1) from the existing residue n, 
                then joins the monomer nn to the existing universe with a bond between each pair of atoms in joins

            ATOM NOMENCLATURE:
                * P1 and Q1 are atoms in monomer n
                * P2 and Q2 are dummy atoms in monomer nn, which correspond to the atoms P1 and Q1
                * R and S are atoms in monomer nn that describe a vector to be aligned to the ortho vector during the linearise fit; 
                    intended for making straight orthoganal branches for ease of visibility 
                    this must be chosen carefully so the rotation doe not break stereochemistry or alignment
            JOINS NOMENCLATURE:
                * joins contains pairs of atoms to be linked, of the form (X_n,Y_nn)
                * X_n   is some atom in residue n, the final residue before extension
                * Y_n+1 is some atom in residue nn, the new residue
        
        Note: 
            this function preserves all dummy atoms. Removing dummy atoms 
            during extension causes substantial problems with indexing. They 
            must only be removed once the polymer is fully built. Save your 
            polymer to a .gro or .pdb file with the PDB.save() method, which will strip
            any dummy atoms.
